DATABASE SETUP

The project uses entity framework for the database connections.
It ONLY uses local database therefore it is mandatory to copy the following files to your local directory.

Files:
BioEngResearchSecurity.mdf
BioEngResearchSecurity_log.ldf

Path:
Win8
C:\Users\<user>

IF YOU UPDATE YOUR LOCAL DATABASE REMEMBER TO COPY IT TO YOUR GIT HUB REPO SO EVERYONE WILL HAVE THE SAME COPY
